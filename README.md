# Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022

This is my submission for Shopify's Backend Developer Intern Challenge for Summer of 2022. It is a simple CRUD web app for a logistics company that allows the user 
to create, read, update, and delete items. 

For my one additional feature I chose to implement "Push a button export product data to a CSV"

* Built Using: 
- ruby 2.6.2p47
- Rails 5.2.6
- csv

* Setup Instructions:

Here is how to get the application running locally: 

To seed some test data: 

rails db:seed

To run the rails server: 

rails server

The web app should be accessible at:

http://localhost:3000/


* Some screenshots of the application:
